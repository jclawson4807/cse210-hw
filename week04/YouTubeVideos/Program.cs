Elder Holland, you may not ever read this, ever hear of this, but I'd like you to know your words bring me great comfort, but more, have saved my life. I love you elder, and I can't one day wait to greet you in heaven.‚ù§");

We have witnessed them live out their lives in our service, and when their call to return to His presence came, we see equally competent and kind servants get called and continue in like fashion.  Truly grateful for their Christlike examples, their love and their diligence in dedicating their lives to a purpose singular to bringing to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.  Thank you Elder Holland for sharing your love of God....!!");

What i heard in my heart was: Read the words of Helamen and see a description of OUR day in black and white. Come to a knowledge of our awful situation and be grateful  for this warning before it is too late. I pray for the strength to heed that profound and timely warning. Thank you, Elder Bednar, for reminding me that I must be on guard continually. Thank you for quoting President Benson for whom I have great admiration. ‚ù§");
