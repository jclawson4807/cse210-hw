    PromptUserName - Asks for and returns the user's name (as a string)
    PromptUserNumber - Asks for and returns the user's favorite number (as an integer)
    SquareNumber - Accepts an integer as a parameter and returns that number squared (as an integer)
    DisplayResult - Accepts the user's name and the squared number and displays them.
    Your Main function should then call each of these functions saving the return values and passing data to them as necessary.
